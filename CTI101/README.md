## INTELLIGENCE CICLE
*   Planning and Direction
This is where you determine the purpose of your research and what kind of information you are looking for.

*   Collection (gathering of data and information)
Your objective will be the identification of which kind of processes you will use to carry out the collection of such information, and then, using all the techniques you know, obtain the data that will help you carry out your intelligence operation.

*   Processing of data and information
Here your objective is not only the visualization of the information but also the application of decoding, decryption, validation, and evaluation techniques that will allow you to filter the huge amount of information you obtained, to identify useful data for your research.

*   Analysis to produce meaningful intelligence
Here you must compile all the information you filtered in the previous step to obtain the solutions to your initial problem, as well as the creation of a coherent intelligence product (report, conference, etc.) that allows you to clearly explain the process you recently carried out
 
*   Dissemination of intelligence to the clients
Here you must deliver the product you developed throughout the process to the stakeholders (individuals or groups) that requested it. This will help these people make informed and appropriate decisions when tackling the original problem.
