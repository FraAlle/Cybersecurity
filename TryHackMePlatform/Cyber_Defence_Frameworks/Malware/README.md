*   Point of Entry(PoE)
*   Indicators about a malware has been executed on a machine
*   How does the malware perform?
*   Can we prevent and detect further infection?

There are 2 categories when analysing malware:
*   Static analysis: is used to gain high-level abstraction of the sample, it can be easy to decide if a piece of code is malicious or not. Utilizing the signature analysis via checksums means quick, efficent and safe analysis of malware.
*   Dynamic analysis: involves executing the sample and observing what happens.
The hex value for executables is always "4D 5A"

# Obfuscation/Packing

Pakcing is a form of obfuscation that malware authors employ to prevent the analysis of their malware.

# IDA Freeware

Is used for both static and dynamic analysis, and there are two classifications:
*   Disassemblers: reverse the compiled code of a program from machine code to human-readable instruction in assembly
*   Debuggers: essentially facilitate execution of the ptrogram 
Is possible to introduce "breakpoints" at various stages of a program, where the program will execute up until a breakpoint.
