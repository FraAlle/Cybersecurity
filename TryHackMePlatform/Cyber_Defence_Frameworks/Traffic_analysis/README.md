## Traffic analysis

Network security operations contain three base control levels:
*   Physical: prevent unauthorised componentes
*   Technical: data security controls prevent unauthorised
*   Administrative: provide consistency authentication process

The main approaches is the Access Control, and his keys are:
*   Firewall protection
*   Network Access control(NAC): verify device specifications and conditions are compliant with the predetermined profile before connecting to the network
*   Identity Access Management(IAM): controls and manages the asset identities and user access data
*   Load Balancing: distribute tasks over a set of resources and improve overall data processing flow
*   Network segmentation: isolate users' access levels and improve the protection of sensitive/internal devices/data
*   VPN: creates and controls encrypted communication between devices over the netwowrk
*   Zero trust model: configuring and implementing the access and permissions at a minimum level

Key elements of the threat control:
*   IDS/IPS
*   Data loss prevention(DLP)
*   Endpoint protection: 
*   Cloud security
*   SIEM
*   Security Orchestration Automation and Response(SOAR): it helps automate tasks
*   Network traffic analysis and netwrok detection and response

Managed security service
MSS(Managed Security Services) are services that have been outsourced to service providers(MSSPs).

## IDS
*   Network Intrusion Detection System: monitors the traffic flow from various areas of the network.
*   Host-based Intrusion Detection System: monitors the traffic from a single endpoint device.

## IPS
It stop/prevent/terminate the suspicious activity as the detection is performed.
*   Network intrusion prevention system(NIPS): monitor the traffic flow various areas of the network, if something is identified, the connection is terminated.
*   Behaviour-based intrusion prevention system(NBA): monitor the traffi flow from various areas of the network, if something is detected the connection is terminated. This method need a period of "learning" to learn the normal traffic and differentiate the malicious traffic and threats. The system is trained with the normality to detect anormality.
*   Wireless intrusion prevention system(WIPS): monitor the traffic flow from of wireless network.
*   Host-based intrusion prevention system(HIPS): protects the traffic flow from a single endpoint device.
