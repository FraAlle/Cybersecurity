## Traffic analysis

Network security operations contain three base control levels:
*   Physical: prevent unauthorised componentes
*   Technical: data security controls prevent unauthorised
*   Administrative: provide consistency authentication process

The main approaches is the Access Control, and his keys are:
*   Firewall protection
*   Network Access control(NAC): verify device specifications and conditions are compliant with the predetermined profile before connecting to the network
*   Identity Access Management(IAM): controls and manages the asset identities and user access data
*   Load Balancing: distribute tasks over a set of resources and improve overall data processing flow
*   Network segmentation: isolate users' access levels and improve the protection of sensitive/internal devices/data
*   VPN: creates and controls encrypted communication between devices over the netwowrk
*   Zero trust model: configuring and implementing the access and permissions at a minimum level

Key elements of the threat control:
*   IDS/IPS
*   Data loss prevention(DLP)
*   Endpoint protection: 
*   Cloud security
*   SIEM
*   Security Orchestration Automation and Response(SOAR): it helps automate tasks
*   Network traffic analysis and netwrok detection and response
