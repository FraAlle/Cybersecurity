1. APT (Advanced Persistent Threat)
2. ASNs (Autonomous System): a macro network that makes up the Internet that has the same routing policy.
3. CE (Customer Edge): it is a router that delineates a provider-managed VPN service.
4. CTI (Cyber Threat Intelligence)
5. DLP (Data Leak Prevention)
6. DKIM (Domain Keys Identified Mail)
7. DMZ (Demilitarized Zone): demilitarized zones, to protect the LAN, the web server is installed on a different PC. Services are open to everyone. If someone enters the DMZ equipment, it is not possible to access the internal network equipment.
8. EDR (endpoint detection and response): important for its lightweight nature and detection capability, it has traceability.
9. EPP (Endpoint Protection Platform)
10. HA (High Availability): firewall clusters are designed to minimize downtime for critical systems through the use of redundant systems.
11. IAM (Identity Access Management)
12. IdP (Identity Provider): stores and manages the user's identity.
13. IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
14. IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)
15. IRM (Information Rights Management)
16. ISM (Information Security Management)
17. MDR (Managed Detection and Response)
18. MDM/MTM: mobile defense (company like Pegasus)
19. MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching): it is a network that carries information from one to another based on layers and not on network addresses.
20. MSP (Managed Service Provider)
21. NAC (Network Access Control)
22. PAM (Privileged Access Management)
23. PE (Provider Edge): it is a router (edge router) that imposes and removes MPLS layers.
24. PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)
25. RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)
26. RGPD (General Data Protection Regulation): European regulation.
27. SASE (Secure Access Service Edge): applies security from where you enter and where you go. ZTNA + SD-WAN, allows not to stay with just one operator; if one fails, there is another one.
28. SSO (Single Sign-On): allows authenticating the identity of users for all applications.
29. SMB (Server Message Block)
30. SPF (Sender Policy Framework)
31. SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response)
32. SOC (Security Operation Center)
33. TTP (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)
34. UTM (Unified Threat Management): firewall (only reaches layer 4) but works up to layer 7, limiting bandwidth per connection.
35. UEBA (User Entity and Behavior Analytics): user behavior and identities.
36. VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
37. WAF (Web Application Firewall): application firewall.
38. XDR (Extended Detection and Response)
39. ZTNA (Zero Trust Network Access): I don't trust when entering an infrastructure.
40. SDWAN (Software Defined Wide Area Network): provides routing, threat protection, and simplification of WAN network management.
